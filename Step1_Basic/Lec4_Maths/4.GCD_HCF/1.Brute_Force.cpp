Find GCD of two numbers

Problem Statement: Given two integers N1 and N2, find their greatest common divisor.

The Greatest Common Divisor of any two integers is the largest number that divides both integers.

Examples
                Example 1:
                Input:N1 = 9, N2 = 12
                
                
                Output:3
                Explanation:Factors of 9: 1, 3 and 9
                Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
                Common Factors: 1, 3 out of which 3 is the greatest hence it is the GCD.



                                
                Example 2:
                Input:N1 = 20, N2 = 15
                
                
                Output: 5
                Explanation:Factors of 20: 1, 2, 4, 5
                Factors of 15: 1, 3, 5
                Common Factors: 1, 5 out of which 5 is the greatest hence it is the GCD.
                

Brute Force Approach:

#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int findGcd(int n1, int n2) {
    // Initialize gcd to 1
    int gcd = 1;

    // Iterate from 1 up to
    // the minimum of n1 and n2
    for (int i = 1; i <= min(n1, n2); i++) {
        // Check if i is a common
        // factor of both n1 and n2
        if (n1 % i == 0 && n2 % i == 0) {
            // Update gcd to the
            // current common factor i
            gcd = i;
        }
    }

    // Return the greatest
    // common divisor (gcd)
    return gcd;
}
// Time Complexity: O(min(N1, N2))
// Space Complexity: O(1)

int main() {
    int n1 = 20, n2 = 15;

    // Find the GCD of n1 and n2
    int gcd = findGcd(n1, n2);

    cout << "GCD of " << n1 << " and " << n2 << " is: " << gcd << endl;

    return 0;
}
