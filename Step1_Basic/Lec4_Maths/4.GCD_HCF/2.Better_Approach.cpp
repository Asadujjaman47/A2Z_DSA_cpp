Find GCD of two numbers

Problem Statement: Given two integers N1 and N2, find their greatest common divisor.

The Greatest Common Divisor of any two integers is the largest number that divides both integers.

Examples
                Example 1:
                Input:N1 = 9, N2 = 12
                
                
                Output:3
                Explanation:Factors of 9: 1, 3 and 9
                Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
                Common Factors: 1, 3 out of which 3 is the greatest hence it is the GCD.



                                
                Example 2:
                Input:N1 = 20, N2 = 15
                
                
                Output: 5
                Explanation:Factors of 20: 1, 2, 4, 5
                Factors of 15: 1, 3, 5
                Common Factors: 1, 5 out of which 5 is the greatest hence it is the GCD.

#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int findGcd(int n1, int n2) {
    // Iterate from the minimum of
    // n1 and n2 down to 1
    // Start from the minimum of n1 and n2
    // because the GCD cannot
    // exceed the smaller number

    for (int i = min(n1, n2); i > 0; i--) {
        // Check if i is a common
        // factor of both n1 and n2
        if (n1 % i == 0 && n2 % i == 0) {
            // If i is a common factor,
            // return it as the GCD
            return i;
        }
    }
    // If no common factors are found,
    // return 1 (as 1 is always a
    // divisor of any number)
    return 1;
}
// Time Complexity: O(min(N1, N2))
// Space Complexity: O(1)

int main() {
    int n1 = 20, n2 = 15;

    // Find the GCD of n1 and n2
    int gcd = findGcd(n1, n2);

    cout << "GCD of " << n1 << " and " << n2 << " is: " << gcd << endl;

    return 0;
}
