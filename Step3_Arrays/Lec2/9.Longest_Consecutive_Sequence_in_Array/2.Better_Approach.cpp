/**
 * Longest Consecutive Sequence in an Array

Problem Statement: You are given an array of ‘N’ integers. You need to find the length of the longest sequence which contains the consecutive elements.

Examples

Example 1:

Input: [100, 200, 1, 3, 2, 4]

Output: 4

Explanation: The longest consecutive subsequence is 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Input: [3, 8, 5, 7, 6]

Output: 4

Explanation: The longest consecutive subsequence is 5, 6, 7, and 8.


Better Approach(Using sorting):

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int longestSuccessiveElements(vector<int> &a) {

    int n = a.size(); // size of array
    if (n == 0) return 0;

    // sort the array:
    sort(a.begin(), a.end());
    int lastSmaller = INT_MIN;
    int cnt = 0;
    int longest = 1;
    
    // find longest sequence:
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (a[i] - 1 == lastSmaller) {

            // a[i] is the next element of the
            // current sequence.
            cnt += 1;
            lastSmaller = a[i];
        }
        else if (a[i] != lastSmaller) {
            cnt = 1;
            lastSmaller = a[i];
        }
        longest = max(longest, cnt);
    }

    return longest;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> a = {100, 200, 1, 2, 3, 4};
    int ans = longestSuccessiveElements(a);
    cout << "The longest consecutive sequence is " << ans << "\n";
    return 0;
}

// Time Complexity: O(NlogN) + O(N)

// Space Complexity: O(1)
