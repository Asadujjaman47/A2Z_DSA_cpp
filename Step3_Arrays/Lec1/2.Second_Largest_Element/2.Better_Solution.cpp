/*
Find Second Smallest and Second Largest Element in an array

Problem Statement: Given an array, find the second smallest and second largest element in the array. Print ‘-1’ in the event that either of them doesn’t exist.

Examples

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,4,7,7,5]
Output: Second Smallest : 2
	Second Largest : 5
Explanation: The elements are as follows 1,2,3,5,7,7 and hence second largest of these is 5 and second smallest is 2

Example 2:
Input: [1]
Output: Second Smallest : -1
	Second Largest : -1
Explanation: Since there is only one element in the array, it is the largest and smallest element present in the array. There is no second largest or second smallest element present.

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void getElements(int arr[], int n) {
    if (n == 0 || n == 1)
        cout << -1 << " " << -1 << endl; // edge case when only one element is present in array
    int small = INT_MAX, second_small = INT_MAX;
    int large = INT_MIN, second_large = INT_MIN;
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        small = min(small, arr[i]);
        large = max(large, arr[i]);
    }
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] < second_small && arr[i] != small)
            second_small = arr[i];
        if (arr[i] > second_large && arr[i] != large)
            second_large = arr[i];
    }

    cout << "Second smallest is " << second_small << endl;
    cout << "Second largest is " << second_large << endl;
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 5};
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
    getElements(arr, n);
    return 0;
