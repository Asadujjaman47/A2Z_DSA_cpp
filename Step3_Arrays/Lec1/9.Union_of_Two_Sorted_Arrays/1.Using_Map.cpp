Union of Two Sorted Arrays

Problem Statement: Given two sorted arrays, arr1, and arr2 of size n and m. Find the union of two sorted arrays.

The union of two arrays can be defined as the common and distinct elements in the two arrays.NOTE: Elements in the union should be in ascending order.

Examples

Example 1:
Input:
n = 5,m = 5.
arr1[] = {1,2,3,4,5}  
arr2[] = {2,3,4,4,5}
Output:
 {1,2,3,4,5}

Explanation: 
Common Elements in arr1 and arr2  are:  2,3,4,5
Distnict Elements in arr1 are : 1
Distnict Elemennts in arr2 are : No distinct elements.
Union of arr1 and arr2 is {1,2,3,4,5} 

Example 2:
Input:
n = 10,m = 7.
arr1[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
arr2[] = {2,3,4,4,5,11,12}
Output: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12}
Explanation: 
Common Elements in arr1 and arr2  are:  2,3,4,5
Distnict Elements in arr1 are : 1,6,7,8,9,10
Distnict Elemennts in arr2 are : 11,12
Union of arr1 and arr2 is {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12} 

Solution 1: Using Map

        freq[arr1[i]]++;

        freq[arr2[i]]++;
    for (auto &it : freq)
