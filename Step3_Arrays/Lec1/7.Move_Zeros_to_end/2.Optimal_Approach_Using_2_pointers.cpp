/*
Move all Zeros to the end of the array

In this article we will learn how to solve the most asked coding interview problem: "Move all Zeros to the end of the array"

Problem Statement: You are given an array of integers, your task is to move all the zeros in the array to the end of the array and move non-negative integers to the front by maintaining their order.

Examples

Example 1:
Input: 1 ,0 ,2 ,3 ,0 ,4 ,0 ,1
Output: 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,1 ,0 ,0 ,0
Explanation: All the zeros are moved to the end and non-negative integers are moved to front by maintaining order

Example 2:
Input: 1,2,0,1,0,4,0
Output: 1,2,1,4,0,0,0
Explanation: All the zeros are moved to the end and non-negative integers are moved to front by maintaining order

Optimal Approach(Using 2 pointers): 
*/

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

vector<int> moveZeros(vector<int> arr, int n) {
    int j = -1;
    // place the pointer j:
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == 0) {
            j = i;
            break;
        }
    }

    // no non-zero elements:
    if (j == -1)
        return arr;

    // Move the pointers i and j
    // and swap accordingly:
    for (int i = j + 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] != 0) {
            swap(arr[i], arr[j]);
            j++;
        }
    }

    return arr;
}
// Time Complexity: O(N)
// Space Complexity: O(1)

int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {1, 0, 2, 3, 2, 0, 0, 4, 5, 1};
    int n = arr.size();
    vector<int> ans = moveZeros(arr, n);
    for (auto &it : ans)
        cout << it << " ";
    cout << "\n";
    return 0;
}
