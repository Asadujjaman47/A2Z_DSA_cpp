/*
Search Element in a Rotated Sorted Array


Problem Statement: Given an integer array arr of size N, sorted in ascending order (with distinct values) and a target value k. 
Now the array is rotated at some pivot point unknown to you. Find the index at which k is present and if k is not present return -1.

Examples

Example 1:
Input Format: arr = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2,3], k = 0
Result: 4
Explanation: Here, the target is 0. We can see that 0 is present in the given rotated sorted array, nums. Thus, we get output as 4, which is the index at which 0 is present in the array.

Example 2:
Input Format: arr = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], k = 3
Result: -1
Explanation: Here, the target is 3. Since 3 is not present in the given rotated sorted array. Thus, we get the output as -1.

Naive Approach (Brute force):

int search(vector<int>& arr, int n, int k) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == k)
            return i;
    }
    return -1;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
    int n = 9, k = 1;
    int ans = search(arr, n, k);
    if (ans == - 1) 
        cout << "Target is not present.\n";
    else 
        cout << "The index is: " << ans << "\n";
    return 0;
}
